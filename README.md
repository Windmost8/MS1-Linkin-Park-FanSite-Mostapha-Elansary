# Linkin Park Fan-Site MS1
This is a site intended for users who have heard about Linkin Park but want to know more, but also for users that have never heard about
Linkin Park and want to explore. 

## UX
As mentioned before, this site is intended for fans that don't know it yet, and fans yet to become. Therefore as such, all users alike must
have access to information on the band, such as small facts, or a brief history, or be able to listen to some sample songs most importantly 
as this a site is about a musical band. Having said that, the goal is to allow users a simple way to navigate and explore.

### User Stories as well:
* As a visiting user, I want to be able to explore the bands history and what they are about. Whats their style of music?
* If I want to be able to explore deeper or engage with the band further, how will I do that? There are links to Linkin Park's socials at the 
footer of each page.
* Who are the members of this band? I would want to find that out in order to connect with them.
* Maybe they have cool art or images that would make me intrested in them as well? What sort of art style do they have?

### Features
* Feature: Navigation and Home Link - Allows for easy navigation throughout the site to desired information.
* Feature: Footer Socials - Social media links are displayed at each page for easy acess to related social medias, opened by a new link.
* Feature: Explore page Music - In the explore page, that can be either clicked on directly, or taken to by a "Learn More" buton from the Home page

* Feature: Contact - Allows users to fill out a form in order to inquiry anything they wish relating to the band. Form includes first name, last name
email address, and text area for inquiry.

#### Future possible Features:

2. A merchandise menu/page for purchases.

### Typography and Color Scheme
Typography included bootstrap classes for h1-h6 displays and certain p tags. 
Also included werre various font sizes, ranging from px to %.
In addition, the Oswald font family was used for easier readabilty in the "Learn More" button.

In terms of color, a beige body background was used to ease unto the eyes.

### Wireframes
All wireframes for the 3 major devices, desktop, mobile, and tablet are included in the directory folder "wireframes". Shown there are the intended
outcomes of the project and its responsivness. In terms of the mobile and tablet devices, certain wireframes were elongated so simulate scrolling.
Also, the burger icon shows the menus already out on the wireframes, whereas in reality they are only shown that way when clicking on the burger
icon. By default they are hidden.

### Technologies Used
This project was done using HTML and CSS , with the help of boostrap's library. 
[bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)
Bootstrap offers a wide variety of tools and useful layout and functionaliyt help, in order to both optimize your site for responsivness, 
which was a big reason for the use of bootstrap in this project, but as well as for smooth design that is user friendly.

### Testing

All user story conditions work on both tablets and mobile, in addition to desktop. The abiltiy to listen to music and view images is possible
and the readabilty of the present text is also clear. The images are responsive with the aid of bootstrap.

Testing was done through the inspect option of google chrome for mobile and tablet responsivness. Although mobile was more the focus.
These devices included:
* Moto G4
* Galaxy S5
* Pixel 2
* Pixel 2 XL
* iPhone 5/SE
* iPhone 6/7/8
* iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
* iPhone X
* iPad
* iPad Pro
* Surface Duo
* Galaxy Fold
#### The output of these devices is the intended output provided in the wireframes, with the exception of slight scroll differences.

* Testing for the HTML code passed the W3c benchmark.
* Testing for the CSS code passed the Jigsaw benchmark.

Supported browsers include Google Chrome.

Almost all links present in the project link to an offical wikipeadia page with the relevant information, and social media links open up tab
to their offical links.
Quotes present on the home page were taken from Linkin Park's official song lyrics, with the songs mentioned and sourced on the page itself.

The idea of a band fan site resonated with me personally since I personally like and listen to the band.
This website is only for educational purposes.
