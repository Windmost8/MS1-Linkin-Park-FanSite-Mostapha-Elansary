# Linkin Park Fan-Site MS1
This is a site intended for users who have heard about Linkin Park but want to know more, but also for users that have never heard about
Linkin Park and want to explore. 

## UX
As mentioned before, this site is intended for fans that don't know it yet, and fans yet to become. Therefore as such, all users alike must
have access to information on the band, such as small facts, or a brief history, or be able to listen to some sample songs most importantly 
as this a site is about a musical band. Having said that, the goal is to allow users a simple way to navigate and explore.

### User Stories as well:
* As a visiting user, I want to be able to explore the bands history and what they are about. Whats their style of music?
* If I want to be able to explore deeper or engage with the band further, how will I do that? There are links to Linkin Park's socials at the 
footer of each page.
* Who are the members of this band? I would want to find that out in order to connect with them.
* Maybe they have cool art or images that would make me intrested in them as well? What sort of art style do they have?

### Typography and Color Scheme
Typography included bootstrap classes for h1-h6 displays and certain p tags. 
Also included werre various font sizes, ranging from px to %.
In addition, the Oswald font family was used for easier readabilty in the "Learn More" button.

In terms of color, a beige body background was used to ease unto the eyes.

### wireframes
All wireframes for the 3 major devices, desktop, mobile, and tablet are included in the directory folder "wireframes". Shown there are the intended
outcomes of the project and its responsivness. In terms of the mobile and tablet devices, certain wireframes were elongated so simulate scrolling.
Also, the burger icon shows the menus already out on the wireframes, whereas in reality they are only shown that way when clicking on the burger
icon. By default they are hidden.

### Testing

All user story conditions work on both tablets and mobile, in addition to desktop. The abiltiy to listen to music and view images is possible
and the readabilty of the present text is also clear. The images are responsive with the aid of bootstrap.

Testing was done through the inspect option of google chrome for mobile and tablet responsivness. Although mobile was more the focus.

Devices tested:

iPad - for tablet sizes
iPhone 5/S - for avergage phone sizes
iPhone X - for closest to latest mobile sizes.

The output of these devices is the intended output provided in the wireframes, with the exception of slight scroll differences.
