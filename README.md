Welcome Windmost8,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!

#Linkin Park Fan-Site MS1
This is a site intended for users who have heard about Linkin Park but want to know more, but also for users that have never heard about
Linkin Park and want to explore. 

##UX
As mentioned before, this site is intended for fans that don't know it yet, and fans yet to become. Therefore as such, all users alike must
have access to information on the band, such as small facts, or a brief history, or be able to listen to some sample songs most importantly 
as this a site is about a musical band. Having said that, the goal is to allow users a simple way to navigate and explore.

###User Stories as well:
* As a visiting user, I want to be able to explore the bands history and what they are about. Whats their style of music?
* If I want to be able to explore deeper or engage with the band further, how will I do that? There are links to Linkin Park's socials at the 
footer of each page.
* Who are the members of this band? I would want to find that out in order to connect with them.
* Maybe they have cool art or images that would make me intrested in them as well? What sort of art style do they have?

###Features
*Feature: Navigation and Home Link - Allows for easy navigation throughout the site to desired information.
*Feature: Footer Socials - Social media links are displayed at each page for easy acess to related social medias, opened by a new link.
*Feature: Explore page Music - In the explore page, that can be either clicked on directly, or taken to by a "Learn More" buton from the Home page
allows for easy sampling of music to listen to what type and genre Linkin Park plays music in. Simple click of a button to play.
*Feature: Contact - Allows users to fill out a form in order to inquiry anything they wish relating to the band. Form includes first name, last name
email address, and text area for inquiry.

*Future possible Features:
1. We could showcase collabarations with other bands so that fans and users may broaden their knowledge on the band and genre.
2. A merchandise menu/page for purchases.

###Typography and Color Scheme
Typography included bootstrap classes for h1-h6 displays and certain p tags. 
Also included werre various font sizes, ranging from px to %.
In addition, the Oswald font family was used for easier readabilty in the "Learn More" button.

In terms of color, a beige body background was used to ease unto the eyes.

###wireframes
All wireframes for the 3 major devices, desktop, mobile, and tablet are included in the directory folder "wireframes". Shown there are the intended
outcomes of the project and its responsivness. In terms of the mobile and tablet devices, certain wireframes were elongated so simulate scrolling.
Also, the burger icon shows the menus already out on the wireframes, whereas in reality they are only shown that way when clicking on the burger
icon. By default they are hidden.

###Testing

All user story conditions work on both tablets and mobile, in addition to desktop. The abiltiy to listen to music and view images is possible
and the readabilty of the present text is also clear. The images are responsive with the aid of bootstrap.

Testing was done through the inspect option of google chrome for mobile and tablet responsivness. Although mobile was more the focus.

Devices tested:

iPad - for tablet sizes
iPhone 5/S - for avergage phone sizes
iPhone X - for closest to latest mobile sizes.

The output of these devices is the intended output provided in the wireframes, with the exception of slight scroll differences.
